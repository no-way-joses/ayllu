## Background
As college students, there are times when we definitely feel the distance being away from our families. During the academic year, it can be hard to find time to talk with them especially with how hectic our schedules can be. We wanted to create an app to close the distance with our families, or anyone long-distance that we miss!

## Functions
###Mood Tracker!
Choose from 5 different moody dogs to "check-in" on how your day was! After checking in, you can see a feed on how the rest of your "family" is doing!

###Event Planner!
With the help of Gemini AI, create different events with your family and track them in a feed-style! Gemini AI automatically suggests an event depending on the time of the year!

## Tech Stack
- Front End - Tailwind CSS, Next.js
- Back End - Python, Clerk, API Gateway
- Database - dynamoDB

## Challenges we ran into

Setting up a secure user authentication system while maintaining a user-friendly experience was a challenge we had to overcome. Throughout the development process, we had to learn and adapt to new technologies, including Tailwind CSS and Next.js, which required time and effort to become proficient in using them effectively.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We proudly implemented the mood tracker feature, allowing users to express their feelings creatively through personalized icons. We designed an intuitive and visually appealing user interface, making it easy for family members of all ages, specially elderly people, to navigate and interact with the app. The integration of Gemini AI to suggest events based on the time of year was a significant achievement, enhancing family engagement.

## What we learned

Working as a team highlighted the importance of effective collaboration and communication. We developed better strategies for sharing ideas, troubleshooting issues, and managing project timelines, which strengthened our teamwork. We enhanced our technical skills by learning new technologies.

## What's next for Ayllu

Our next step is to expand the AI features to offer more personalized event suggestions based on user preferences and location. We plan to introduce a daily check-in question feature to prompt family members to share what’s on their mind. We’re also working on displaying the status of family members, so users can quickly see updates on their loved ones. Additionally, we'll be implementing an event countdown feature, letting families track how soon their upcoming plans will happen, building excitement and anticipation. We also want to implement uploading photos to the events and everyday photos, and utilizing AI to create a family photo album and videos allowing families to relive memories together.
